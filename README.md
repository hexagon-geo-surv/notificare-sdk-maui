> At this point the MAUI SDK is NOT maintained by Notificare, this is a community project initiated by [Leica Geosystems AG](https://leica-geosystems.com/)
> We hope for Notificare to take over our efforts and make this an officially maintained SDK.

The Notificare MAUI SDK makes it quick and easy to communicate efficiently with many of the Notificare API services and enables you to seamlessly integrate our various features, from Push Notifications to Contextualised Storage.
